This project is my personal website, hosted on GitHub. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it features an internal database that stores project data in JSON and Markdown files.

As the site evolved, I enhanced the user experience by adding dynamic SVG animations with a Figma extension. Projects are displayed in a dynamic card layout using JavaScript, and the project database is managed by a custom Node.js script, which automatically updates through GitHub Actions.
