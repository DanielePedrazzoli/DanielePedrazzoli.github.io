This project is my thesis final, featuring a step counter device. It uses the MPU6050 sensor to detect user movement and estimate distance. The MPU6050, a 6-axis accelerometer and gyroscope, sends data to the ESP32 via I2C. The ESP32 processes this data, leveraging its Digital Motion Processor (DMP) to recognize steps by analyzing and filtering the accelerometer data, while removing gravitational effects for accurate step detection.
