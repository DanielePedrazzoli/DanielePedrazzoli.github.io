This project is a "Serial Plotter" built with Flutter to graphically display data from serial devices (e.g., microcontrollers) connected to a computer. Inspired by the Arduino Serial Monitor tool, it connects to serial ports, reads data, and plots it. All messages are stored, but only those starting with a specific character are plotted. The rest are saved for reference. This tool provides a simple and efficient way to visualize real-time data from serial communication.
