I attended [ITIS Leonardo da vinci](https://www.itivinci.mo.it/) in Carpi, where I obtained my <strong>high school diploma</strong> in the academic year 2018/2019.
During these years, I developed a strong interest in technical and scientific subjects, particularly electronics and computer science. The curriculum of this school provided me with a solid theoretical and practical foundation, adequately preparing me for university studies.

Afterward, I continued my studies at the [Università di Modena e Reggio Emilia](https://www.unimore.it/it).
I earned my <strong>bachelor’s degree</strong> in electronic engineering in July 2024, defending a thesis titled “Design of a Movement Analyzer and Pedometer Based on the Espressif ESP32-Wroom Module and the MPU6050 Sensor,” supervised by Professor Simone Benatti.
