During my high school studies, I had the opportunity to participate in two internships that allowed me to get closer to the working world and apply the theoretical knowledge acquired in class:

- Internship at <strong>Rebix</strong> (duration: one week) - April 2018
During this short period, I got to know the dynamics of a company and assisted the business owner with tasks such as component soldering, warehouse organization, and assembling electronic boards. This internship allowed me to develop skills in THT and SMD component soldering.

- Internship at <strong>Rebix</strong> (duration: two weeks) - March 2019
In this second internship, I took on a more active role within the company, handling tasks such as programming boards via terminal and performing tests on them. I also improved my soldering skills.

- During my university studies, I worked as a mobile application developer using the Flutter framework, a tool (developed by Google) that allows the creation of mobile, desktop, and web applications using the Dart programming language for <strong>Gamma Sistemi</strong>.
Even though these experiences were occasional jobs, they had a significant impact on my professional development. Many of my projects rely on this framework to create the interface with the microcontroller.
